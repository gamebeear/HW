# This is only for Techlent Homework

# The first step of a data science project is collecting data. Web crawler is a commonly used technique in data acquisition.

# You can start from Web Crawler course. Collaborate with your teammate, but don’t copy their codes. Interviewers would ask you about technical details, you had better build it yourself.

# Crawler-link.txt: Open an account on Github(https://github.com). Create a public repo. Push the code files of your web crawler to the repo. Copy and paste the repo link to “crawler-link.txt”
